There should be multiple Power submodules. 
Now I have only one, that takes the eurorack power from the 10 pin IDC socket and generates 5 volt using a voltage regulator. the socket outputs -5 to 5 volt set by the potentiometer as a generic CV source as the submodule need to have at least 2 panel mounted elements, but there will be more Power submodules with different controls. For example one with a DC jack input or one with phono output...
