The VCA is based on the Skull & Circuits VCA1.3 (https://www.skullandcircuits.com/vca-1-2/?v=910955a907e7)
It has an Input, Control and Output jacks and a potentiometer. The potentiometer attenuates the Control input. The is no standard "normal" wired to the Control, so if you want to be able to use it without a control input, you can solder +5v to the "normal" pin of the jack.
