# Synthesizer Submodules
A collection of submodules with various synthesizer functions.
All the submodules will have at least 2 panel mounting controls/jacks so it can be fixed to the front panel.
The frontpanel is based on a  10x10mm grid of 6.8mm holes. 
This allows the frontpanels to be re-used to take any combination of the submodules.
This does mean a design limitation of what controls to use.
By seperating all the functions of the synthesizer in this way, it allows me to focus and optimize one function at a time.
And because the submodules have there own controls, the frontpanel becomes transparant in use. for example: 
a VCO submodule has a 1v/o pitch input jack, a tune potentiometer and a output jack. And to be able to modulate the pitch I can add a mixer submodule in front where the modulation CV can be mixed with the pitch CV. The output of this mixer is sent to the "normal" of the pitch jack. This makes it able to use the mixer and the VCO submodules for anything you want because the "normal" connections can be disconnected.
